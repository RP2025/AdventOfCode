# Advent of Code 2025 — Raksha Pahariya

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2025** repository!  
Here, I solve daily coding challenges and document my approaches, including classical and quantum simulations, data structures, and optimization techniques.

Each folder contains my **code and notes** for that day. For deeper explanations and blog-style write-ups, see the links below.
